# VMQemuVGA v8.0 - Basic Display Driver for macOS Virtualization

**Honest Documentation - What Actually Works**

Basic display driver for macOS virtualization with Snow Leopard compatibility. Provides essential framebuffer functionality and VirtIO GPU integration for QEMU/KVM virtual machines.

## üéØ What Actually Works

### ‚úÖ **Working Display Features**
- **Basic 2D Framebuffer**: Functional display output with multiple resolutions
- **Snow Leopard Compatibility**: Fully working on macOS 10.6.8
- **VirtIO GPU Integration**: Basic GPU communication for display operations
- **Resolution Support**: Multiple display modes up to 1920x1080
- **Stable Installation**: Safe installer that won't cause kernel panics
- **System Integration**: Proper IOKit framework integration

### ‚úÖ **Compatibility & Stability**
- **Symbol Resolution**: All 14 missing Snow Leopard symbols resolved
- **Stub Implementations**: 14 stub methods prevent crashes when advanced APIs are called
- **Clean Termination**: Proper cleanup during driver shutdown
- **Safe Installation**: Installer doesn't attempt to unload active display drivers

## üö´ What Doesn't Actually Work (Stub Functions Only)

### **VMPhase3Manager Stubs (3 methods)**
- `setDisplayScaling()` - Just logs and returns success
- `configureColorSpace()` - Just logs and returns success  
- `enableVariableRefreshRate()` - Just logs and returns success

### **VMVirtIOGPU Stubs (11 methods)**
- `enable3DAcceleration()` - Just logs "(stub)"
- `enableVirgl()` - Just logs "(stub)"
- `enableVSync()` - Just logs "(stub)" 
- `updateDisplay()` - Just logs parameters and returns success
- `mapGuestMemory()` - Sets gpu_addr to 0 and returns success
- `setBasic3DSupport()` - Just logs "(stub)"
- `enableResourceBlob()` - Just logs "(stub)"
- `setOptimalQueueSizes()` - Just logs "(stub)" and returns true
- `setupGPUMemoryRegions()` - Just logs "(stub)" and returns true
- `initializeVirtIOQueues()` - Just logs "(stub)" and returns true
- `setMockMode()` - Just logs "(stub)"

## üìã Technical Reality

**What the system reports:**
- IORegistry shows "3D Acceleration = Enabled" ‚úÖ
- IORegistry shows "Shader Manager = Enabled" ‚úÖ 
- IORegistry shows "Max Texture Size = 4096" ‚úÖ
- IORegistry shows various advanced features ‚úÖ

**What actually happens:**
- All advanced features are just stub functions that return success
- No actual 3D acceleration, shaders, or texture processing
- System thinks features work because stubs don't fail
- Perfect for basic display needs, useless for actual 3D applications

## üéØ Best Use Cases

**‚úÖ Perfect For:**
- Snow Leopard virtualization with working display
- Basic desktop usage and application compatibility
- Retro computing projects needing stable display
- Development/testing environments

**‚ùå Not Suitable For:**
- Actual 3D applications or games
- GPU-accelerated video processing
- Modern graphics-intensive applications
- Hardware-accelerated rendering

## üîß Installation

1. Download VMQemuVGA-v8.0-Private.pkg
2. Run: `sudo installer -pkg VMQemuVGA-v8.0-Private.pkg -target /`
3. Reboot (driver will be active after restart)

**Note:** Installer is safe and won't cause kernel panics during installation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimers

- **No actual 3D acceleration** - all advanced features are stubs
- **Basic display only** - works great for 2D desktop usage
- **Compatibility stubs** prevent crashes but don't provide functionality
- **IORegistry misleading** - reports features as working when they're just stubs
- **Snow Leopard focused** - primarily tested on macOS 10.6.8

## üìä Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ **Zero kernel panics** during installation
- ‚úÖ **Stable system operation** on Snow Leopard
- ‚úÖ **All symbols resolved** - no more link failures
- ‚úÖ **Working display output** at various resolutions
- ‚úÖ **Clean driver lifecycle** - proper loading/unloading

---

**Bottom Line:** This is a working, stable display driver for Snow Leopard virtualization. It provides excellent basic display functionality while maintaining compatibility with modern graphics APIs through stub implementations. Perfect for retro computing, but don't expect actual 3D acceleration.
